## Solution

Let's connect to the attached server:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/checkpoint/Amaze_me# nc maze.csa-challenge.com 80
The great Mount of Moria towered over a maze that concealed a lustrous treasure, the Nauglamir.
The treasure is still present from the days of the great king Thingol,
but is secretly hidden in a maze after being stashed away by dwarfs.
Unfortunately, the last copy of the map of the maze was lost,
but we hope you will still be able to help us locating the Nauglamir.
You will find this is no easy task -
The maze is 250 x 250 big, you have only limited attempts.
You must be really careful in your answers to avoid traps built by the dwarfs to protect the Nauglamir.
Guesses won't help you and we trust your skills and wisdom to guide you in this challenge.
We trust you and wish you good luck, and hope you will find your way to the Nauglamir.
Oh, and just in case it will help you - your starting position is:  (46,185)
> What is your command?
l
0
> What is your command?
r
1
> What is your command?
u
0
> What is your command?
d
0
> What is your command?
```

It looks like a maze, and we can try to move left, right, up and down. If we are successful, the console returns `1`, otherwise `0`.

Using just this information, we can write a simple backtracking program to explore the maze and see if we find anything. We can even log the locations we have visited in a mini-map.

Running such a program would produce an output similar to the following (needless to say, every session produces a different random map):

![](images/maze.png)

There are a few large oval areas which can't be accessed, but apart from that, nothing interesting. We must be missing something.

Let's go back to the command prompt. If we try entering some other commands, we get interesting responses:

```console
Oh, and just in case it will help you - your starting position is:  (35,175)
> What is your command?
c
(35,175)
> What is your command?
i
l=0, r=0, u=0, d=1
> What is your command?
h
Don't forget to eat breakfast, it's the most important meal in the day
> What is your command?
g
far far away
> What is your command?
s
> What is your solution?

Next time we suggest you to keep your guesses to yourself and start walking instead!
```

We see that `i` gives us a summary of the directions we can go to, and `g` says "far far away". Sounds like at some point this command should tell us that we're closer. 
We also have `s` which accepts coordinates - we will probably need to use this to enter the treasure coordinates.

Therefore, the next step is to refactor our backtracking program to query `g`.

We run it, and at some point we get a hit:
```
Your distance from the treasure is âˆš 1855
```

So now we know that `g` tells us our distance from the treasure (in terms of `sqrt(distance)` ).

If we have three such points, we can try to triangulate the treasure.

This is a coding challenge so we'll jump from here straight to the code:

Implementation notes:
* In many cases backtracking is implemented using recursion. However, in this case, the recursion depth is too deep and a stack based backtrack algorithm is implemented instead
* The code uses `z3` to triangulate the treasure given at least three points. To avoid precision errors, if `z3` is unable to solve the set of equations using the first three samples found, the code will continue searching for samples and trying three random samples until the equations can be solved.
* Every once in a while, the code checks its calculated location against the server's location as sanity
* The code starts by checking the distance from the treasure via `g` every 50 steps, for performance reasons. Once `g` returns an actual distance, the cadence is reduced to 2 steps in order to find additional samples quickly
* The code logs the current known map every 100 steps
* MovementOptions received via the `i` command are cached to avoid an additional server request while backtracking
