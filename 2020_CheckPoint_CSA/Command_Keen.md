# Commander Keen in Keen Dreams

This repository contains the source for Commander Keen in Keen Dreams.  It is released under the GNU GPLv2+.  See LICENSE for more details.

The release of the source code does not affect the licensing of the game data files, which you must still legally acquire.  This includes the static data included in this repository for your convenience.  However, you are permitted to link and distribute that data for the purposes of compatibility with the original game.

This release was made possible by a crowdfunding effort.  It is brought to you by Javier M. Chavez and Chuck Naaden with additional support from:

* Dave Allen
* Kirill Illenseer
```

It looks like an Open Source release of the 90s computer game "[Commander Keen in Keen Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen_in_Keen_Dreams)", just like the [previous challenge](Stateful_Keen.md).

We can use this information to find the [original release](https://github.com/keendreams/keen) and diff it against the copy we received.

We find the following significant differences:

```console

        US_CPrint("Status Window - the flag isn't here (      |         US_CPrint("Status Window");
```

The hints are replacing level names and seem interesting. We actually saw these changes in the previous challenge too, but didn't use them.


We can compile the game according to the instructions on the Github repository (but even after compiling, it looks like we need to "borrow" some missing files from a real copy in order to successfully run the game).

When we enter the game, we see:

![](images/keen1.png)

We then arrive to the level map, from which we are able to visit the different levels. If we enter the first level, for example, we see the appropriate hint instead of the level name:

![](images/keen2.png)

All level names have been changes, as can be seen in the code.

Now, we are supposed to play the recordings, so let's take a look at them.

We have 16 recordings, let's take a look at one for example:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/checkpoint/Command_Keen/command-keen/Recordings# xxd -g 2 -c 8 -e 1.BIN | head
00000000: 0005 0000 0000 0000  ........
00000008: 0002 0000 ff81 0000  ........
00000010: 0010 0000 ff81 ff81  ........
00000018: 0003 0000 ff81 0000  ........
00000020: 0001 0000 0000 0000  ........
00000028: 0004 0000 007f 007f  ........
00000030: 0002 0000 0000 007f  ........
00000038: 0002 0000 ff81 0000  ........
00000040: 0001 0000 ff81 007f  ........
00000048: 0003 0000 007f 007f  ........
```

The interpretation, according to the description, is:
```c
typdef struct 
{
    uint16_t movement_counter;
    uint16_t click;
    uint16_t x_direction;
    uint16_t y_direction;
} KeenMovement;
```

The `movement_counter` looks like the number of times we should perform the movement.
The `click` value is zeroed out throughout all of the files so we can ignore it.
We just need to understand how to interpret the `x_direction` and `y_direction` values.

We see the following values throughout the files:
 * `0x0`
 * `ff81`
 * `007f`

We'll make a wild guess that `0x0` means "no movement in this axis". `0x7f` is `127` and `0xff81` is the 2's complement representation of `-127`, so we'll just guess that the same rules of the X-Y axis apply. This means that `(127, 127)` is `up-right`, and `(-127, 0)` is just left.

Now we have a choice. Our first option is to run the game and move Keen inside the game according to the given movements. This has two major downsides: First, some levels are only accessible after finishing other levels first, so in order to have Keen move freely we will have to complete all levels first (probably with cheats though...). And second: Moving Keen takes time, and we'll have to wait this time for each recording.

Our second option is to draw Keen's movements on a map. It is much faster and we won't need to complete any levels. Let's just hope that the recordings don't include Keen hitting obstacles by purpose since then we will have to make our map obstacle-aware.

There is a third option - guessing the flag from the letters (we already know the flag length is 16). This actually worked during the CTF! Take a minute and try it yourself, especially if you are familiar with Keen's background story. This is a writeup so in this case we'll go for the second option though, since it's easier than the first one.

We find a map [here](https://www.commander-keen.com/level-maps-7.php). We can draw the hint letters on each of the levels (we can figure out where each letter goes by researching the original level names) and get:

![](images/small_map.png)

Now we write a short script to draw the route on the map:

```python
from struct import Struct
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageColor
from collections import namedtuple
import itertools, os
import glob

Coordinate = namedtuple("Coordinate", "x y")

def read_records(format, f):    
    record_struct = Struct(format)    
    chunks = iter(lambda: f.read(record_struct.size), b'')    
    return (record_struct.unpack(chunk) for chunk in chunks)


def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -> (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = itertools.tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return zip(a, b) 

DISTANCE_CONST = 0.92
START_COORDINATE = Coordinate(360, 305)

def translate_movement(v):
    if v == -127:
        return -1
    elif v == 127:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def draw(movement_file, output_folder = None):
    coordinates = []
    with open (movement_file, "rb") as f:
        coord = START_COORDINATE
        coordinates.append(coord)
        for rec in read_records('<hhhh', f):
            movement_counter, click, x, y = rec
            assert(click == 0)
            for _ in range(movement_counter):
                coordinates.append(Coordinate(coord.x + DISTANCE_CONST * translate_movement(x), coord.y + DISTANCE_CONST * translate_movement(y)))
                coord = coordinates[-1]

    im = Image.open('small_map.png')
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(im) 
    for current, next in pairwise(coordinates):
        draw.line( ( current, next ), fill = "red", width = 4)
    if output_folder is None:
        im.show()
    else:
        output_file_path = "{}.png".format(os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(movement_file))[0])
        im.save(os.path.join(output_folder, output_file_path))



if __name__ == "__main__":
    output_file_dir = "out"
    os.makedirs(output_file_dir, exist_ok = True)
    for recording in glob.glob("command-keen/Recordings/*.bin"):
        draw(recording, output_file_dir)

```

We run it and get:

![](images/keen_levels/2.png)
![](images/keen_levels/3.png)
![](images/keen_levels/4.png)
